## The assignment

Find any working local assignment. You're free to use any webproject.

Make sure that this website works on your local machine.

## Submitting your work
Inside this assignment repo, create a new branch called **gh-pages** and upload your local work into this branch, **not** in the master branch:

<img src="assignment/create-branch-gh-pages.gif" width="250" alt="how to create new branch called gh-pages" style="margin-left:200px;">

By creating this **gh-pages** branch, you'll automatically publish your work to ```https://<organisation>.github.io/<assignment>-<user>/```. For example: ```https://mia-mmt1-2021.github.io/assignment-1a-bond007/```.

To 'submit' your work, click the **new pull request** button in the Pull requests tab (next to the Code and Issues tab). 
  * Choose **base:master** and **compare:gh-pages** and click the **Create pull request** button.
  * Select **vincentsijben** or **willmuijrers** or **lucvansoest** as a reviewer in the sidepanel on the right (only select 1)
  * Be sure to put the published GitHub Pages URL in the comment section.
  * Do **not** merge this Pull Request yourself. That's up to the reviewer to decide (merging is approving the assignment).
